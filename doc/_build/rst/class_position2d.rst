Generic 2D position hint for editing.

Description
-----------

Generic 2D position hint for editing. It's just like a plain :ref:`Node2D<class_Node2D>`, but it displays as a cross in the 2D editor at all times. You can set cross' visual size by using the gizmo in the 2D editor while the node is selected.
